# MDB-MP1-MeetTheMembers
This is a simple trivia game style app that helps its users memorize the names of the 70 members at MDB. After pressing start on the start screen, the app segues to the main view controller where a picture of a member is shown along with 4 choices. There is a timer that limits the response time to 5 seconds and a pause & resume button that changes labels depending on whether or not the game is playing. Another segue leads to the statistics view controller, where the longest streak of correct answers and a log of the past 3 answers are shown.
